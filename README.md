# F1 Race Data Business Analytics Project

Been a fan of F1, applying my tech knowledge to extract insights and make my watch much interesting

## Objective
Deliver actionable business insights from Formula 1 race data, with a primary focus on strategy optimization, resource efficiency, and performance enhancement. The aim is to solve real-world racing and business problems, and communicate findings with clarity for non-technical stakeholders

## Problem Statement
Formula 1 is a data-driven sport where strategic decisions, driver performance, and resource management are increasingly informed by analytics. This project transforms high-volume race session data into insights that help teams and business leaders outperform competitors, efficiently manage costs, and make informed decisions under strict resource constraints.

## Key Business Questions

- How can race and telemetry data enable optimal strategy and pit stop decisions?
- What metrics and features matter most for predicting performance loss due to tire wear or inconsistent pace?
- How can driver data be used to drive targeted coaching and improve lap times?
- Where are operational inefficiencies hidden in the data, and what solutions are possible?
- How can data visualizations make complex findings easy to understand for business audiences?
- What patterns in lap-time consistency indicate potential mechanical or driver-related issues before escalation?
- How do external factors (weather, track temperature, humidity) affect car and driver performance, tyre degradation, and pit strategies?
- Can segmentation of circuits or driver styles uncover new opportunities for strategic advantage over competitors?
- How do mid-race decisions (e.g., under a safety car) change final race results and points?
- How do leading teams differ from trailing teams according to data, and what are the business implications?
- How can analytics drive proactive risk management during high-stakes moments (qualifying, rain-affected races)?
- How can predictive models support inventory/logistics decisions (spare parts, tires) to reduce costs?
- Are there actionable insights from team radio/communication analysis during critical moments?
- Which telemetry features best predict upcoming pit stops or performance drops, and how can teams act preemptively?
